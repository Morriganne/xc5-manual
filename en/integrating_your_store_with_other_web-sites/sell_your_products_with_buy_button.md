The Buy Button module lets you easily add ecommerce to your blog, website, or email campaign using Buy Buttons that connect with a X-Cart store. You can use Buy Buttons to sell your products on WordPress, Tilda, and Wix, on your own website, or wherever you've already built an audience online. Product cards with the Buy Buttons always show the actual product name and price, even if you modify them on your storefront.

After you've installed the Buy Button module in your X-Cart admin, you can create a new Buy Button for a product. This generates either a snippet of embed code for you to embed in the source HTML of your webpage, or a URL for you to add to your email campaign. After you embed it, the code displays a Buy Button.

## Embedding code

After you create a Buy Button in your X-Cart admin, you're ready to add it to your own website or blog. The process of adding embed code to your website's source HTML is a bit different depending on how and where you want your Buy Buttons and cart to appear, on your website platform.

### Adding to Wordpress blog

You can add embed code to individual posts and to the menu on the homepage of your WordPress blog.

You can also use embedded collections with custom themes to create an entire ecommerce site in WordPress.

{% note info %}
Embedded Buy Buttons are compatible with the **WordPress.org platform** â€” but **not** with WordPress.com, because it strips custom script tags embeds. This documentation describes WordPress 4.2.2. Your version might be different.

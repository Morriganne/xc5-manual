It is possible to add your own logo and favicon images for your store's website:

![xc5_logo.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/xc5_logo.png)

![xc5_favicon.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2VXSZhKE/xc5_favicon.png)


To complete the task, you will need the module **Simple CMS** by X-Cart team. Make sure this module is installed and enabled at your store (If the module is not installed, {% link "install and activate it" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}):

![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389815/7602608.png)

To change the logo and/or favicon for your website:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the **Look & Feel** section and make sure you're viewing the **Logo & Favicon** tab:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389815/8716522.png)
2.  Use the **Browse...** button opposite the item you want to change to select the image you want to use.
3.  Once the image has been selected, click **Submit**.
    The image should be uploaded. Now you can check the result on the storefront: after reloading the page, the new image should be displayed instead of the old one.

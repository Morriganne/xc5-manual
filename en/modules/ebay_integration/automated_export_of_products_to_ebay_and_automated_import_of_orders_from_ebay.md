Export of products from your X-Cart store to eBay and import of orders into your X-Cart store from eBay can be performed automatically via cron. To use this feature, be sure to enable automated periodic execution of X-Cart's script **console.php** before you install the eBay Integration module (For more information on console.php and instructions for running it periodically, see {% link "Configuring automated execution of periodic tasks for X-Payments subscriptions" ref_pTgcx1sg %}). During the installation, the eBay Integration module will create the necessary periodic tasks to be run via console.php.

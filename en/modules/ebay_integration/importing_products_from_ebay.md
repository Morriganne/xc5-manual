If you already have items listed on eBay that you need to have in your X-Cart store as products, you can import them from eBay into your X-Cart store.

To import items from eBay:

1.  In your X-Cart store's Admin area, go to the Import eBay Items page (**Catalog** > **Import eBay Items**)
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9306779/9439199.png)

2.  Specify which orders you want to import by adjusting the following fields:
    * **eBay site**: Specify the eBay marketplace site from which you would like to import items.
    * **Item type**: Select the type of items you would like to import (_Active items_, _Inactive items_).
    * **eBay Item SKU**: Enter the eBay SKU of the item that needs to be imported (Such a SKU can be obtained from the _Custom Label_ field of the item). If you need to import multiple items, enter a comma separated list of SKUs.
    * **Upload item images**: With this option enabled, item images will be imported from eBay along with the item details and description to become product images in your X-Cart store. With this option disabled, eBay items will be imported without the images.
    * **Remove exists products**: 
    * **Import only new items**: Enable this option if you want items to be imported

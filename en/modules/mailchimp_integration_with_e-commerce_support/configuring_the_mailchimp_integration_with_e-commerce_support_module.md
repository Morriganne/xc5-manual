The settings and preferences for the module "MailChimp Integration with Ecommerce support" can be adjusted on the module settings page:

* MailChimp API key: The API key that was used to connect your X-Cart store to your MailChimp account. If, for some reason, you need to use a different MailChimp account or a different key, use the **Reset MailChimp connection** link.
* Enable E-commerce analytics: This option enables E-commerce analytics by MailChimp for your X-Cart store. For details, see the article [Use MailChimp for E-Commerce](http://kb.mailchimp.com/integrations/e-commerce/use-mailchimp-for-e-commerce "Use MailChimp for E-Commerce") in MailChimp Knowledge Base. E-commerce analytics is the core component of the integration functionality; the setting is enabled by default, and we recommend keeping it that way.
* Enable Abandoned Carts:  This option enables the Abandoned Carts feature. For more info on this feature, see the [MailChimp site](https://mailchimp.com/features/abandoned-cart/ "Abandoned Cart")
* Enable single opt-in for customers: This option determines whether customers who opt in to subscribe to your news lists should be asked to confirm the subscription via email, or not. When this option is disabled, new subscribers get an email containing a subscription confirmation link that they need to click to be added to your list (Double opt-in). When this option is enabled, new subscribers are added to your list as soon as they opt in, without having to confirm the subscription by email (Single opt-in). Remember that abusing the single opt-in option may get your account banned by MailChimp.
* Subscription select element type (_Type:checkbox_ or _Type:select box_): This setting defines the way your customers select a subscription. If the select box option is enabled here, your customers can subscribe to only one mail list; if the checkbox option is enabled, your customers can subscribe to multiple lists.
* Update MailChimp lists every (_Never, 1 minute, 10 minutes, etc._): Select the time interval for the periodical list updates.

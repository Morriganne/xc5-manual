If the module "MailChimp Integration with Ecommerce support" is not installed in your store, you can find and install it via the **My addons** section of your store's Admin area.

To use the module, you will need a MailChimp account. If you do not yet have a MailChimp account, you can [sign up here](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup/?source=website&pid=xcart). If you expect to have 2,000 or fewer subscribers and to send up to 12,000 emails per month, you can use MailChimp for free. For higher sending volumes, MailChimp also offers a few [pricing plans](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/).

Once the module "MailChimp Integration with Ecommerce support" has been enabled in your X-Cart store, you will need to connect to your MailChimp account. The connection is done using an API key. Instructions for how to find or generate your API key are available in the MailChimp knowledge base article [About API keys](http://kb.mailchimp.com/integrations/api-integrations/about-api-keys).

Once an API key has been set up for your X-Cart store in your MailChimp account, you can go to the module settings page in your store's Admin area and use one of the following methods to connect to MailChimp:

*   Click on the link "Connect with your MailChimp account". On the MailChimp authorization page, enter your MailChimp login and password. Provided that the authorization goes successfully, your account will be connected to X-Cart automatically.
    OR:
*   Copy the API key you have set up in your MailChimp account for your X-Cart store and paste it into the field that says "Enter your MailChimp API key manually". Save the changes.

Once your X-Cart store has been connected to your MailChimp account, the module settings page in your X-Cart store's Admin area will show your MailChimp API key and provide some settings that you will be able to use to adjust your module preferences. For example, you will be able to toggle the E-commerce analytics and Abandoned carts features, choose how your customers should be able to subscribe to your MailChimp lists (whether a customer should be able to choose more than one list when subscribing, whether an additional confirmation should be required after a customer opts in to subscribe, etc.) For more info, see {% link "Configuring the MailChimp Integration with E-commerce support module" ref_ST1QnErC %}

After you connect your store to MailChimp, be sure to enable e-commerce link tracking when configuring your campaigns or automations to track purchases. 
To turn on e-commerce link tracking for a campaign, follow these steps:

   1.  Navigate to the Setup step of the Campaign Builder.
   2.  In the Tracking section, check the box next to E-commerce link tracking.

X-Cart provides integration with [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com/signup/?pid=xcart&source=website) via a built-in module "MailChimp Integration with Ecommerce support". MailChimp provides a powerful tool to replace X-Cart's built-in newsletter subscriptions feature and enables you to access some exciting e-commerce features like product recommendations, abandoned cart messages, purchase-based automations, and sales reports.

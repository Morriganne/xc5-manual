X-Cart provides integration with [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com/signup/?pid=xcart&source=website) via a built-in module "MailChimp Integration with Ecommerce support".

If the module is not installed in your store, you can find and install it via the **My addons** section of your store's Admin area.

To use the module, you will need a MailChimp account. If you do not yet have a MailChimp account, you can [sign up here](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup/?source=website&pid=xcart). If you expect to have 2,000 or fewer subscribers and to send up to 12,000 emails per month, you can use MailChimp for free. For higher sending volumes, MailChimp also offers a few [pricing plans](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/).

Once the module "MailChimp Integration with Ecommerce support" has been enabled in your X-Cart store, you will need to connect to your MailChimp account. To do so, go to the module settings page in your store's Admin area 

and to adjust some preferences.

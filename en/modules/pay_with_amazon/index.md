X-Cart's Pay with Amazon module provides an integration with Amazon Payments, a payment service that enables buyers to pay on your online store using the payment and shipping information already stored in their existing Amazon accounts. All the interaction of buyers with Amazon Payments takes place in embedded widgets, so that the buyers can complete the checkout process without ever leaving your website.

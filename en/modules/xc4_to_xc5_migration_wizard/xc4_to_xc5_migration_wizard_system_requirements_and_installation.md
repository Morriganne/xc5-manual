At the moment of writing this article, the module "XC4 to XC5 Migration wizard" is available for X-Cart versions 5.3.0 and later. It provides a tool for the migration of data and settings from X-Cart 4 based online stores (versions 4.4.0 or later) to the X-Cart 5 platform. For the most up-to-date information on the module compatibility, please see the [module page](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/migration-wizard.html).

To migrate your X-Cart 4 store to X-Cart 5, you need:
1) Your existing X-Cart 4 store. 
2) A fresh installation of X-Cart 5 (**Important**: Be sure to use the default build configuration that you get right out of the distribution package. Do not install any additional modules and do not attempt any customizations of the X-Cart 5 store's default functionality or look & feel before your X-Cart 4 data and settings have been fully migrated.)

The module can be obtained via X-Cart’s Marketplace:

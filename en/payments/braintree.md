X-Cart can be integrated with [Braintree, A PayPal Service](https://www.braintreepayments.com/). Currently, there are two Braintree integration modules available in the X-Cart Marketplace:
   
   * **[PayPal powered by Braintree](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/paypal-powered-by-braintree.html)** 
   * **[Braintree payment gateway](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/braintree-for-xcart5.html)**

The module "PayPal powered by Braintree" is the newer of the two. It is the most advanced payment solution from PayPal to date, and it is based on the latest Braintree API. 
The module "Braintree payment gateway" is an older version of the integration based on the previous version of Braintree API. 
Because the new API (the one used by "PayPal powered by Braintree") is currently available only to users in the USA, UK and France, we are keeping the module "Braintree payment gateway" available to X-Cart customers through the Marketplace as it uses an API available in many more countries.

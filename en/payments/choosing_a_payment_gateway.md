## Overview
A payment gateway is an essential part of your online strategy. Popular shopping carts are compatible with a great variety of payment systems widely known as payment gateways. But how can you choose the one that is right for you? You do not have the luxury of rectifying a wrong decision. Apart from the cost of the service, you stand to lose out much more - customers, orders, fraud related losses, integration time, time to market etc.
On the stage of getting your online store live, you will likely face the problem of accepting credit card payments from your customers. It is the most common and convenient payment method available over the Internet. To be able to accept credit card payments at your X-Cart based online store, you will need to subscribe for the service of a payment gateway which will process credit cards for you. Payment gateway service is available from such companies as Authorize.NET, PayPal, WorldPay, 2CheckOut and some others.
There are several significant benefits when using this type of service:
*   Most payment gateways have a sophisticated fraud protection mechanism that helps to avoid most chargebacks from the customers whose credit card might have been stolen by hackers.
*   The process is fully automated so you can save a vast amount of time if you have many orders.
*   Some payment gateways like 2CheckOut enable you to accept credit cards even if you do not have an internet merchant account (It may be difficult to obtain a merchant account if you have just started a business and haven't got a positive credit history yet).

## Choice criteria

### Things to ask first
Some important initial questions you should ask of any potential vendor of billing software include:
*   How long has the company been in business?
*   What is the history of the company?
*   How long has the particular features package you're interested in been on the market?
*   How many and what types of Web services use their software?
*   Are client references available for you to call?
*   Is a demo version of the software available?
*   What is the availability and accessibility of system setup, training and support, as well as the approximate cost of these essential items?
*   Will the company be able to import data from your previous billing system, if necessary, and what is the expected cost for this service? have they been successful with this?
*   What are the hardware and networking requirements recommended by the software vendor for optimum efficiency?
*   What is the cost of their 'basic' system and what is 'included'? What additional products are available at an extra charge to enhance the basic software package?

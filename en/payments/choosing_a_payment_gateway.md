## Overview
A payment gateway is an essential part of your online strategy. Popular shopping carts are compatible with a great variety of payment systems widely known as payment gateways. But how can you choose the one that is right for you? You do not have the luxury of rectifying a wrong decision. Apart from the cost of the service, you stand to lose out much more - customers, orders, fraud related losses, integration time, time to market etc.
On the stage of getting your online store live, you will likely face the problem of accepting credit card payments from your customers. It is the most common and convenient payment method available over the Internet. To be able to accept credit card payments at your X-Cart based online store, you will need to subscribe for the service of a payment gateway which will process credit cards for you. Payment gateway service is available from such companies as Authorize.NET, PayPal, WorldPay, 2CheckOut and some others.
There are several significant benefits when using this type of service:
*   Most payment gateways have a sophisticated fraud protection mechanism that helps to avoid most chargebacks from the customers whose credit card might have been stolen by hackers.
*   The process is fully automated so you can save a vast amount of time if you have many orders.
*   Some payment gateways like 2CheckOut enable you to accept credit cards even if you do not have an internet merchant account (It may be difficult to obtain a merchant account if you have just started a business and haven't got a positive credit history yet).

## Choice criteria

### Things to ask first
Some important initial questions you should ask of any potential vendor of billing software include:
*   How long has the company been in business?
*   What is the history of the company?
*   How long has the particular features package you're interested in been on the market?
*   How many and what types of Web services use their software?
*   Are client references available for you to call?
*   Is a demo version of the software available?
*   What is the availability and accessibility of system setup, training and support, as well as the approximate cost of these essential items?
*   Will the company be able to import data from your previous billing system, if necessary, and what is the expected cost for this service? have they been successful with this?
*   What are the hardware and networking requirements recommended by the software vendor for optimum efficiency?
*   What is the cost of their 'basic' system and what is 'included'? What additional products are available at an extra charge to enhance the basic software package?

### Merchant account
First, you should draw a line between payment gateways that require a merchant account and those that don't.
Payment gateways requiring a merchant account usually offer attractive commission rates, for example 1.8% of each transaction, a fixed $0.20 from each transaction, and a series of monthly charges grouped under several headings, usually amounting to less than $100. This means that your company keeps a greater share of gross sales.
On the other hand, payment gateways requiring a merchant account have several disadvantages:
*   They seldom engage in fraud prevention and rather leave it in the hands of the seller to decide which transactions are safe to accept and which should be rejected. If the company suffers a high rate of fraud, the gateway provider may terminate the service.
*   Moreover, signing up for a merchant account can take around one month, and these are usually only granted to incorporated companies with an existing financial background.
*   Lastly, it can be hard to get authorization for transactions with certain credit cards such as American Express and Diners Club.
In the case of payment gateways not requiring a merchant account, the main advantages are:
*   You will be ready to sell immediately.
*   Fraud prevention tools are provided free of charge.
*   There are usually no fixed charges (only a commission over transactions).
Of course the disadvantage is a less attractive commission rate, usually between 5.5% and 12%, with a $0.80 fixed rate per transaction. It is also worth noting that the name on the customer's credit card statement will be the name of the payment company, not yours.

### Integration, customization and branding
From the technological point of view, you should consider the type of integration and security measures offered by each gateway. One of the most important criteria is that your customers receive a consistent and smooth transaction experience through this process. Many 3rd party payment gateways forget this fact.
The feature acceptable for quick implementation is web form integration with the payment gateway: integration simply consists of a web form to send payment information. In a typical transaction, therefore, your —Åustomer is shunted from your website to the payment gateway website. The look and feel of both websites are different resulting in a non-consistent experience. This is proven to reduce the trust factor for a customer. Some payment gateways allow you to put a header banner, or a logo. This however is not enough to provide a consistent experience. Some of the best payment services allow complete customization of the payment pages. You can change the text color, size, font, background colors, header, header background, etc. - all through an easy-to-use web based interface. In selecting a payment gateway, ensure that you obtain an interface that allows you to completely customise the payment pages.
If you are looking to get a secure and uniform integration, you should choose a gateway with the most complex integration method. However, the first thing you should do is consult with your hosting provider if you comply with all the requirements (SSL certificate, permission to install components, permission to open ports in the firewall, etc.)

### Fraud detection and risk mitigation
Indeed, business loss from online fraud can be daunting. So merchants have realised the importance of taking measures to minimise losses occurring due to online fraud. It is important that the payment gateway you choose supports basic fraud detection and risk mitigation measures. Note that fraud detection does not simply end with AVS, or CVV2. Most payment gateways will offer you CVV (Verified by Visa) checking. While it is an additional measure, it does not successfully detect fraudulent patterns. Ideally choose a payment gateway that offers you fraud detection tools apart from just AVS and CVV2.

### Transaction features
Credit card transactions have a versatile set of features. There are various modes of transaction that can be performed. Auth-capture, sale mode, reversal, partial captures, partial reversals etc. It is important that the payment gateway supports all the transaction modes. Various business occasions require different combinations of these transaction modes.
For instance, if a customer places an order you will want to authorise the transaction. If you do not have all the items the customer has ordered, you will need to initiate a partial capture at the time of delivery. If the customer has got the items, but one of them is damaged, they will return it back to you, and in this case you will need to initiate a partial refund.

### Security
Financial transactions require profound security measures. And it is not only the Verisign 128 bit Digital Certificate which most payment gateways have. Security is a ground-up activity which needs to be effectively planned. There are several facets to take care of, including the datacenter physical security (where the payment gateway servers are hosted), OS and application security, firewall and intrusion detection systems at the OS and application layer, database security, and, finally, transaction security. Each of these requires initial establishment and continuous monitoring. Verify that the payment gateway you choose controls all the facets of security on an ongoing basis.

### Easy integration
Time-to-market is the mantra for online businesses. Every online customer lost to a competitor represents higher customer acquisition costs. Additionally, most merchants today outsource their website development. It is crucial therefore that the payment gateway offers you an easy integration process. This is another area where few payment gateways offer ready-made integration kits for all possible platforms. Quite a few payment gateways implement only complex Socket based APIs requiring you to write clients in specific languages to talk proprietary protocols. Another common problem faced here is that some payment gateways have integration kits that require a DLL or a component to be installed on your server. This becomes an issue if you are hosted in a virtual hosting environment. Your server provider may not be willing to install any component on their servers. Make sure to check up on the feasibility of the integration process in detail before you make you mind in the choice of a payment gateway.

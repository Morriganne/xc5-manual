## About product reviews
The module **Product reviews** (included in X-Cart business) enables the product ratings and reviews feature for your X-Cart store.

With this module, customers can leave feedback for the products they purchased and see what other buyers think about the products and the store. 

The store administrator has full product review management capabilities: 

   * choose who can write product reviews (any site visitors, registered customers or just those who have purchased the product in this store);   
   * review the feedback submitted by customers and decide in each case, whether the review should be posted or rejected;
   * search for specific reviews and filter reviews;
   * edit and even create new reviews from the Admin area. 

## Configuring the Product reviews module
To set your preferences for product reviews:
   1. In the list of your store's installed modules, locate the entry for Product reviews and click the **Settings ** button below it:

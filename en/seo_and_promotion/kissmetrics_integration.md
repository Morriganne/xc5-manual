[Kissmetrics](https://www.kissmetrics.com/) is a popular behavioral analytics and engagement platform. By integrating your X-Cart store with Kissmetrics you get a mighty tool to analyze your online store and customersâ€™ behaviour in it.

An X-Cart 5 store can be connected to Kissmetrics using one of the following methods:
   
   * Method 1: Paste some Kissmetrics-provided JS code into your store using X-Cart's custom JS feature (supported by X-Cart versions 5.1 and later). 
   * Method 2: Connect X-Cart to Kissmetrics by means of the free Segment Integration module (available for all X-Cart 5 versions).

## Method 1: Paste some Kissmetrics-provided JS code into your store using X-Cart's custom JS feature

To connect your X-Cart store to Kissmetrics using this method, follow the steps below:

   1.  In the Admin area of your X-Cart store, go to Look and Feel > Custom JavaScript. A page like the following will be opened:
   <img>
    
   2.  Make sure the "Use Custom JS" selector above the text area is set to "ON". 
    
   3. In a new browser tab or window, go to the Settings page in your Kissmetrics account and copy the JS code for pasting onto your site. Go back to the tab/window with the Admin area of your X-Cart store and paste the JS code you have copied into the text area for custom JS code. Be sure to remove the script tags (<script type="text/javascript"> and </script>) wrapping this JS code, as X-Cart adds such tags automatically in the background. 
    
   4. Save the changes by clicking the **Save changes** button.

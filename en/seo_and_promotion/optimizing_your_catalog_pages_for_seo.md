X-Cart provides some settings for SEO optimization of your store's catalog pages.

These settings allow you to:

*   define meta elements of your product and category pages - such as the page title, meta description and meta keywords.
*   configure custom SEO-friendly "Clean URLs"  for your product and category pages.

For a product, SEO optimization related settings can be found on the **Info** tab of the product's details page:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389820/8719379.png)

For a category, these settings can be found on the **Category info** tab of the category's details page:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389820/8719380.png)

Note that by default X-Cart generates Clean URLs for product and category pages automatically: you simply need to make sure the **Autogenerate Clean URL** checkbox option is enabled before you click the button to save the details of the product or category you've been editing.

If necessary, you can manually edit the automatically generated Clean URLs; for that you would need to uncheck the **Autogenerate Clean URL **option and edit the **Clean URL** field directly.

If you want to provide free shipping on a specific product, use the following method:

1.  In your store's back end, locate the product for which you want to configure free shipping.
2.  Click through to edit the details of this product . On the **Info** tab of the product details, enable the option **Free shipping**:

     (This option is available only for tangible goods; i.e. the property **Requires shipping** / **Shippable** must be set to "Yes" for the setting **Free shipping** to be visible).

3.  Use the **Update product** button at the bottom of the screen to save the changes. 

Now X-Cart will know that the cost of shipping for this product should be "0" (zero).

If necessary, you can use this method to enable free shipping on multiple products (and even on all the products in your store). It is also the method to use if you want to provide a "free in-store pickup" option for your products.

Note, however, that for the case when a customer's shopping cart contains only products with free shipping your store will need a free shipping method selectable at checkout. We provide a special shipping method for this purpose - "Free shipping". If you are going to provide free shipping on any products at your store, make sure this method is active:

 If necessary, you can edit the name and description of this method. For example, you may wish to change the name from "Free shipping" to "Free in-store pickup". To do so, click on the method name and adjust the information you require.

If your business is based in Canada and you need to configure taxes like Canadian VAT, PST (QST) or HST, we recommend using the module **Canadian Taxes** for tax setup.

To start using the module "Canadian Taxes", ensure that it is installed and enabled in your store's Installed Modules section.

This article explains how to set up and enable the calculation of Canadian taxes using the module "Canadian Taxes" for X-Cart 5. 

## Configuring Canadian taxes

Before you configure your taxes:

1.  Ensure that each of the products in your store to which a tax needs to be applied has a tax class assigned to it. You can create your custom tax classes or use the "Default tax class" that is assigned to all your products by default. 

    See:
    
    *   {% link "Creating tax classes" ref_pAWOdG8N#creating-tax-classes %};
    
    *   {% link "Assigning tax classes to products" ref_pAWOdG8N#assigning-tax-classes-to-products %}.

2.  Ensure that your store has all the necessary address zones configured. You will need these zones to use different tax rates based on the customer address.
    
    See:
    
    *   {% link "Setting up destination (address) zones" ref_r68iO5Rm %}
    
3.  If you are going to need different tax rates for different customer membership levels, ensure that the necessary user membership levels have been set up. 
    
    See:
    
    *   {% link "Adding user membership levels" ref_9ITFspcC %}

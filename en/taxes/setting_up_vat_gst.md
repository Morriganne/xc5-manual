If you are required to charge buyers a value added tax (VAT) or a goods and services tax (GST), we recommend using the module '''Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax''' for tax setup. This module is specifically designed for businesses in the UK, EU, Australia and other countries where you need to be able to charge VAT / GST. The module allows you to use different tax rates based on the membership level and address of the customer. It also supports tax exemption based on customer's VAT ID.

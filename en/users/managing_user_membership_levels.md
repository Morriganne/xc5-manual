To give privileges to certain categories of customers and to restrict access of other customers to these privileges, set up user membership levels. Using membership levels enables you to:
* provide groups of customers with exclusive access to certain products and categories;
* set up membership-specific discounts;
* set up membership-specific tax rates.

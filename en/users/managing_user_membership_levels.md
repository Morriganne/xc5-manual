To give privileges to certain categories of customers and to restrict access of other customers to these privileges, set up user membership levels. Using membership levels enables you to:

    * provide groups of customers with exclusive access to certain products and categories;
    * set up membership-specific prices and discounts;
    * set up membership-specific tax rates.

User membership levels can be set up and managed using the Membership levels section of your store's Admin area (**Users > Membership levels**). In this section, you can see a list of membership levels available to your store's users (if any such levels have been added) and button to add new levels.

## Adding membership levels
To create a new membership level:
1.  In your store's Admin area, go to **Users > Membership levels** and click the **New membership** button.
2.  

## Membership signup
Administrator reviews the application and, in the case of a positive decision, assigns the membership to the user who requested it. When the option 'Enable sign-up for membership ' is disabled, there is no 'Signup for membership' box in the 'Profile details' form, but administrator can still assign memberships to customers.

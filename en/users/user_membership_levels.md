To give privileges to certain categories of customers and to restrict access of other customers to these privileges, set up user membership levels. Using membership levels enables you to:

*   provide groups of customers with exclusive access to certain products and categories;
*   set up membership-specific prices and discounts;
*   set up membership-specific tax rates.

User membership levels can be set up and managed using the Membership levels section of your store's Admin area (**Users > Membership levels**). 

## Adding membership levels
To create a new membership level:
1.  In your store's Admin area, go to **Users > Membership levels** and click the **New membership** button. This adds a new blank field in the membership levels table.

2.  In this field, type the name of the membership level you require. For example, let us name our new membership level "VIP customers":
    ![xc5_memberships_vip_customers.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_RXsgxNSm/xc5_memberships_vip_customers.png)

3.  Click **Save changes**.
    ![xc5_memberships_membership_save.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_RXsgxNSm/xc5_memberships_membership_save.png)
The new membership level will be saved and added to the list of your store's membership levels.

## Viewing and managing membership levels
The Membership levels section (**Users > Membership levels**) provides a table with a list of membership levels available to your store's users (if any such levels have been added):
    ![xc5_memberships_list.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_RXsgxNSm/xc5_memberships_list.png)
    
For each membership level, you can see the name and the number of store users who have been assigned this membership level:
    ![xc5_memberships_name_users.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_RXsgxNSm/xc5_memberships_name_users.png)

The state of the On/Off button icon tells you if the membership level is currently active or disabled (Only active membership levels can be assigned to users).
    ![xc5_memberships_on_off.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_RXsgxNSm/xc5_memberships_on_off.png)
    To switch the activity status of a membership level, click on the On/Off button icon opposite its name to select the desired status and click **Save changes**.
    
The order in which the membership level names are shown in the table determines the order of membership level names in the drop-down box used to assign membership levels to specific users. You can change the order of the membership level names in the table - simply drag and drop the level whose position needs to be changed by the four arrow icon:
    ![xc5_memberships_4arrow.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_RXsgxNSm/xc5_memberships_4arrow.png)
    Be sure to save the changes.
    
If necessary, you can change the name of any membership level. To do so, click on the level name; once the level name field becomes active, make your changes and save:



## Membership signup
Administrator reviews the application and, in the case of a positive decision, assigns the membership to the user who requested it. When the option 'Enable sign-up for membership ' is disabled, there is no 'Signup for membership' box in the 'Profile details' form, but administrator can still assign memberships to customers.

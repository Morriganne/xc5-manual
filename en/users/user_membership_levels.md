To give privileges to certain categories of customers and to restrict access of other customers to these privileges, set up user membership levels. Using membership levels enables you to:

*   provide groups of customers with exclusive access to certain products and categories;
*   set up membership-specific prices and discounts;
*   set up membership-specific tax rates.

User membership levels can be set up and managed using the Membership levels section of your store's Admin area (**Users > Membership levels**). This section provides a table with a list of membership levels available to your store's users (if any such levels have been added) and a button to add new membership levels.

## Adding membership levels
To create a new membership level:
1.  In your store's Admin area, go to **Users > Membership levels** and click the **New membership** button. This adds a new blank field in the membership levels table.

2.  In this field, type the name of the membership level you require. For example, let us name our new membership level "VIP customers":
    ![xc5_memberships_vip_customers.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_RXsgxNSm/xc5_memberships_vip_customers.png)

3.  Click **Save changes**.

## Membership signup
Administrator reviews the application and, in the case of a positive decision, assigns the membership to the user who requested it. When the option 'Enable sign-up for membership ' is disabled, there is no 'Signup for membership' box in the 'Profile details' form, but administrator can still assign memberships to customers.

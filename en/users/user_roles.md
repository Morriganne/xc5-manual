X-Cart roles enable you to configure different levels of access to the store's back end for different administrator users. A role is a set of permissions providing access to certain features and areas of the back end. This feature may be useful if you have staff who you want to give the permissions to do some of the store management jobs but not others.

After installation, your X-Cart store already has some roles configured - you can view them in the Roles section of the Admin area (**Users** > **Roles**).

_Administrator_ is the role providing Root access to the store's back end, which means that an administrator with this role has full access to all the features.
Other roles provide limited access to just some of the features. To find out the specific access permissions for each role, click on the role names in the Roles table. For example, if we click on the role name _Coupons management_, we will see a page like the following:
![xc5_roles_coupons_management.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_38HKdc1f/xc5_roles_coupons_management.png)

As you can see from the screenshot above, the role _Coupons management_ provides its user with an only permission - to manage coupons. It means that an administrator with this role will be able to log in to the store's back end, but all they will see there will be the following:
![xc5_roles_only_coupons.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_38HKdc1f/xc5_roles_only_coupons.png)
They will be able to view and use the Coupons page within the Promotions section (create coupons, view and edit existing coupons, delete coupons):
![xc5_roles_only_coupons1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_38HKdc1f/xc5_roles_only_coupons1.png)
but that is basically all they will be able to do.

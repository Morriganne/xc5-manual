X-Cart has two major types of users depending on the X-Cart store area where they primarily operate:

   *   Administrators;
   *   Customers.
   
X-Cart customers are users of the Customer area - a zone of an X-Cart store where one can view and buy products. Generally, we may call anyone who views the storefront and acts as a shopper (this includes viewing products, adding products to the shopping cart and placing orders) a "customer". Not all customers, however, are the same: some just browse through the site and leave, others choose to buy stuff. Those who choose to buy stuff may do it as a guest without registering an account, or may prefer to create an account so as to have access to their order history and be able to reuse their registration name and address for future purchases. So, if we wanted to emphasize the difference between these types of customers, we would say that the ones who come to the store and navigate the site viewing the publicly accessible pages of the Customer area are just "visitors" or "shoppers", the ones who sign up for an account and maintain a user profile with the store are "registered customers", and the ones who make a purchase without creating a permanent account (using guest checkout) are "anonymous customers".
